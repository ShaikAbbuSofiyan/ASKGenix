## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
1. User enters credentials
2. Query users table for matching email
3. Compare password_hash field
4. If match:
   - Store user ID in localStorage
   - Set user state in AuthContext
   - Route to appropriate dashboard
5. If no match:
   - Display error message
```

### Test Taking Flow

```typescript
1. Student clicks "Start Test"
2. System checks for existing in-progress attempt
3. If exists: Resume from last saved state
4. If not: Create new attempt record with:
   - test_id
   - user_id
   - started_at (current timestamp)
   - status: 'in_progress'
5. Load all questions for test
6. Load existing answers (if resuming)
7. Calculate time remaining from started_at
8. Start countdown timer
9. On answer selection:
   - Update local state
   - Upsert to attempt_answers table
10. On submit (manual or auto):
    - Stop timer
    - Calculate score for each question
    - Update attempt with:
      - submitted_at
      - time_taken_seconds
      - score
      - status ('submitted' or 'auto_submitted')
    - Update all attempt_answers with is_correct and marks_obtained
    - Redirect to dashboard
```

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
For each question:
  1. Get user's selected answers (array of option IDs)
  2. Get correct answers from question record
  3. Sort both arrays for comparison
  4. Check if arrays are identical:
     - Length must match
     - All elements must match in sorted order
  5. If correct:
     - Award full marks for question
     - Set is_correct = true
  6. If incorrect:
     - Award 0 marks
     - Set is_correct = false
  7. Sum marks from all questions = total score
```

### CSV Export Implementation

```typescript
1. Format headers array
2. Map each result to row array with formatted values
3. Convert 2D array to CSV string with:
   - Comma-separated values
   - Quoted fields to handle commas in content
   - Newline-separated rows
4. Create Blob with CSV content
5. Create temporary download link
6. Trigger download with formatted filename
7. Clean up temporary link
```

## Security Specifications

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled with the following policies:

**users:**
- Users can read and update only their own profile
- No public insert (registration handled separately)

**tests:**
- Admins: Full CRUD access
- Students: Read access to active tests only

**questions:**
- Admins: Full CRUD access
- Students: Read access to questions of active tests only

**test_attempts:**
- Admins: Read access to all attempts
- Students: Full access to their own attempts only

**attempt_answers:**
- Admins: Read access to all answers
- Students: Full access to their own answers only

### Data Validation

**Client-Side:**
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Minimum value constraints
- Array length validation

**Database-Side:**
- NOT NULL constraints
- CHECK constraints on enums
- CHECK constraints on numeric ranges
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints

### Data Integrity

**Cascade Deletes:**
- Deleting test → deletes all questions, attempts, and answers
- Deleting user → deletes all their attempts and answers
- Deleting attempt → deletes all related answers

**Referential Integrity:**
- All foreign keys enforced
- ON DELETE CASCADE for dependent records
- ON DELETE SET NULL for optional references (e.g., test creator)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for joins
- Commonly queried fields (is_active, user_id, test_id)

### Query Optimization
- Use of `maybeSingle()` for 0-or-1 results
- Selective column fetching with `select()`
- Proper use of `order()` clauses
- Batched operations where possible

### Frontend Optimization
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Conditional rendering to minimize DOM updates
- Debouncing not needed (Supabase handles rate limiting)
- Loading states for async operations

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Timer & Submission
1. **Browser closure during test**: Time continues server-side, can resume
2. **Timer expiration**: Automatic submission with status 'auto_submitted'
3. **Network failure during answer save**: Uses Supabase retry logic
4. **Multiple rapid submissions**: Prevented by setting submitting state
5. **Time manipulation**: Server-side time calculation from started_at

### Test Management
1. **Deleting test with attempts**: Cascade delete ensures data consistency
2. **Editing test with in-progress attempts**: Only metadata updated, not questions
3. **Deactivating test during student attempt**: Student can complete
4. **Zero questions in test**: Validation prevents creation

### User Experience
1. **Unanswered questions**: Counted as incorrect, 0 marks
2. **Navigating away from test**: Answers preserved via auto-save
3. **Duplicate email registration**: Database constraint prevents, error shown
4. **Invalid credentials**: Generic error message for security
5. **Empty test results**: Appropriate empty states shown

---

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Authentication**: Plain text passwords (not production-ready)
2. **Single attempt**: Students can only attempt each test once
3. **No question bank**: Questions created per-test, no reusability
4. **Limited question types**: Only MCQ and multiple correct
5. **No negative marking**: Incorrect answers score 0
6. **No test scheduling**: Tests are either active or inactive
7. **No email notifications**: No automated communications
8. **No proctoring**: No monitoring during test

### Potential Enhancements
1. Password hashing with bcrypt or Supabase Auth
2. Multiple attempt support with best score tracking
3. Question bank with tagging and categories
4. Additional question types (fill-in-blank, essay, coding)
5. Configurable marking schemes (negative marking, partial credit)
6. Schedule tests with start/end dates and times
7. Email notifications for test activation and results
8. Webcam proctoring and browser lockdown
9. Analytics dashboard with charts and graphs
10. Bulk student import via CSV
11. Test templates and duplication
12. Question difficulty levels and adaptive testing
13. Mobile app for students
14. Real-time test monitoring for admins
15. Detailed reports and certificates
